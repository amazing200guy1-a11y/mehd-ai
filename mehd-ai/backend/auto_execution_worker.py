Mehd AI — Auto-Execution Worker (HARDENED v2)
==============================================
FIXES APPLIED:
  P0 #9:  daily_auto_trades_count now resets at midnight UTC
  P0 #2:  Signal freshness gate (max 5 minutes old)
  P0 #4:  Per-user asyncio.Lock prevents concurrent execution races
  P0 #5:  Duplicate position check before broker execution
  P1 #1:  OLYMPUS anomaly flags checked from signal vote data
  P1 #10: Per-user risk evaluation (no shared kernel contamination)
  P1 #11: ATR-based SL/TP fallback when consensus doesn't provide them
